# AsthmaApp

Apple CareKit application aiming to amend the disease management of people struggling with asthma. 
This project was submitted as my dissertation project in the final year of study. 

Project provided me with my first exposure to mobile development methodologies, asynchronous programming, 
working with cloud-based database and applying an extensive research into the design of the final product(this app).
